/** Question
 * Provide a list of integers return indices that
 * sums up to target
 */

/** Verify Constraints
 * Are all numbers going to be positive
 * -> Yes all numbers are positive no negative numbers
 * Are there going to be duplicates do we account for duplicates 
 * that might add up to the targets, depending on the target
 * -> No, there are no duplicates
 * Will there always be soultion... would two values always add up to the
 * Target
 * -> No, there may not always be a solution
 * What do we return if there is no solution
 * -> We return Null
 * Can there be multiple pair that sum up to the target?
 * -> No, only 1 pair of numbers will add up to the target
